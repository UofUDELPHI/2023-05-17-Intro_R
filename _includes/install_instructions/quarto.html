  <h3>Quarto</h3>

  <p>
    <a href="https://quarto.org/">Quarto</a> is an open-source scientific 
    and technical publishing system that lets us combine text, code, and 
    outputs so that we can easily write reports and research papers. 
    We create quarto documents within
    <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/">RStudio</a>, but to use quarto, 
    you need to install it from <a href="https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/">here</a>.
