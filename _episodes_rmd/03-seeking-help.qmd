## Reading Help Files

R, and every package, provide help files for functions. The general syntax to search for help on any
function, "function_name", from a specific function that is in a package loaded into your
namespace (your interactive R session) is:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
?function_name
help(function_name)
```

For example take a look at the help file for `write.table()`, we will be using a similar function in an upcoming episode. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
?write.table()
```

This will load up a help page in RStudio (or as plain text in R itself).

Each help page is broken down into sections:

 - Description: An extended description of what the function does.
 - Usage: The arguments of the function and their default values (which can be changed).
 - Arguments: An explanation of the data each argument is expecting.
 - Details: Any important details to be aware of.
 - Value: The data the function returns.
 - See Also: Any related functions you might find useful.
 - Examples: Some examples for how to use the function.

Different functions might have different sections, but these are the main ones you should be aware of. 

Notice how related functions might call for the same help file: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
?write.table()
?write.csv()
```

This is because these functions have very similar applicability and often share the same arguments as inputs to the function, so package authors often choose to document them together in a single help file.

> ## Tip: Running Examples

> From within the function help page, you can highlight code in the 
> Examples and hit <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Return</kbd> to run it in 
> RStudio console. This gives you a quick way to get a feel for
> how a function works.

{: .callout}

## Special Operators

To seek help on special operators, use quotes or backticks:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
?"<-"
?`<-`
```

## Getting Help with Packages

Many packages come with "vignettes": tutorials and extended example documentation.
Without any arguments, `vignette()` will list all vignettes for all installed packages;
`vignette(package="package-name")` will list all available vignettes for
`package-name`, and `vignette("vignette-name")` will open the specified vignette.

If a package doesn't have any vignettes, you can usually find help by typing
`help("package-name")`.

RStudio also has a set of excellent
[cheatsheets](https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) for many packages.


## When You Remember Part of the Function Name

If you're not sure what package a function is in or how it's specifically spelled, you can do a fuzzy search:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
??function_name
```

A fuzzy search is when you search for an approximate string match. For example, you may remember that the function 
to set your working directory includes "set" in its name. You can do a fuzzy search to help you identify the function:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
??set
```

## When You Have No Idea Where to Begin

If you don't know what function or package you need to use
[CRAN Task Views](http://cran.at.r-project.org/web/views)
is a specially maintained list of packages grouped into
fields. This can be a good starting point.

## When Your Code Doesn't Work: Seeking Help from Your Peers

If you're having trouble using a function, 9 times out of 10,
the answers you seek have already been answered on
[Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/). You can search using
the `[r]` tag. Please make sure to see their page on 
[how to ask a good question.](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask)

If you can't find the answer, there are a few useful functions to
help you ask your peers:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
?dput
```

Will dump the data you're working with into a format that can
be copied and pasted by others into their own R session.

```{r}
sessionInfo()
```

Will print out your current version of R, as well as any packages you
have loaded. This can be useful for others to help reproduce and debug
your issue.
